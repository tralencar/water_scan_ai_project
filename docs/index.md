# CRISP-DM Methodology in Water Scan AI

The **Water Scan AI** project adopted the **CRISP-DM** (Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining) methodology to structure the end-to-end development of a water potability prediction solution. Below is a description of each phase as applied to this project.

---

## ðŸ“˜ 1. Business Understanding

The project began with a deep understanding of the water quality problem: **predicting water potability**. The strategic goal was to **enhance public health** and **ensure safe water access** through **predictive analytics**.

- **Primary objective**: Predict whether a water sample is **potable** (1) or **non-potable** (0) based on physical and chemical parameters.

---

## ðŸ“Š 2. Data Understanding

The dataset was explored to understand its structure and identify patterns:

- **EDA techniques** like histograms, boxplots, KDE plots, and correlation heatmaps were applied.
- Observations included:
  - Potable water tended to have higher pH and lower turbidity.
  - Some water samples had significantly higher levels of sulfates and turbidity.
  - Certain features, such as **chloramines** and **conductivity**, were strongly correlated with potability.
- Missing values and outliers were identified and addressed during data preprocessing.

---

## ðŸ›  3. Data Preparation

In this phase, the dataset was cleaned and transformed:

- **Missing values** were handled using the median imputation technique.
- **Categorical features** were encoded, and numerical features were standardized.
- The target variable (`Potability`) was mapped to binary (0 or 1).
- **SMOTE** was applied to balance the classes.
- **Train-test split** was performed, ensuring stratification based on potability.

---

## ðŸ¤– 4. Modeling

Several models were trained and compared:

- **Random Forest**
- **XGBoost**

All models were evaluated with:

- `Accuracy`, `F1-Score`, `Precision`, `Recall`, `ROC AUC`
- Confusion matrices, feature importance, and learning curves were used for evaluation.

---

## âœ… 5. Evaluation

The models were assessed both quantitatively and visually:

- **Random Forest** was the best performer, achieving high accuracy and stable performance across different evaluation metrics.
- **Feature importance** revealed that variables such as `ph`, `hardness`, and `conductivity` were most predictive of water potability.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Summary

CRISP-DM provided a clear, iterative roadmap to:

- Understand the water potability prediction problem
- Prepare, model, and evaluate data scientifically
- Deliver **business-driven recommendations** to improve water quality monitoring and ensure safe water access

Water Scan AI is a **modular**, **interpretable**, and **reproducible** solution for predicting water potability, ensuring public health and environmental sustainability.
