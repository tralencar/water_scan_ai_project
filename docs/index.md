# Water Scan AI

ðŸ’§ **Water Scan AI** is a Machine Learning project that classifies water potability using preprocessing techniques, class balancing, hyperparameter optimization, and model versioning with MLflow.

- **Project Name**: `water_scan_ai`
- **Author**: `tralencar`
- **Version**: "1.0.1"
- **License**: `MIT`
- **Keywords**: `quality`, `water`
- **Data Source**: [Dataset (Water Quality)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adityakadiwal/water-potability/data) from Kaggle.

## ðŸ”¹ Features

âœ… Programming Language: `Python` <br>
âœ… Structured using the `Factory Method Pattern` for trainer creation <br>
âœ… Uses the `Facade Pattern` in the logging module with MLflow (`MLFlowLogger`) <br>
âœ… Uses the `Singleton Pattern` to manage entries in the MLflow Registry <br>
âœ… Hyperparameter optimization with `Optuna` <br>
âœ… Class balancing with `SMOTE` (imblearn) <br>
âœ… Logging and tracking of experiments using `MLflow` <br>
âœ… Model registration and versioning with `MLflow Model Registry` <br>
âœ… Metric and artifact visualization with `matplotlib` and `MLflow` <br>
âœ… Evaluation using `scikit-learn` metrics <br>
âœ… Supports `Random Forest` models, with structure ready for XGBoost and LightGBM <br>
âœ… Code quality tools: `Pre-commit`, `Ruff`, `Black`, `Flake8`, `Isort` <br>
âœ… Task automation using `Makefile` <br>
âœ… Semantic version control with `bump2version` <br>
âœ… Automated testing with `Pytest` + `Pytest-Cov` <br>
âœ… Auto-generated documentation using `MkDocs` + `MkDocs Material` <br>
âœ… Automatic formatting and linting with `Ruff`, `Black`, and `Isort` <br>
âœ… Git hook support for code validation using `Pre-commit` <br>
âœ… Code structured using the `Singleton Pattern` for model registry management <br>
âœ… Modular and reusable architecture using `Poetry` for dependency management <br>
âœ… **Continuous Integration (CI)** with `GitHub Actions` for code quality validation, including: <br>
ðŸ”¹ - Automated quality checks on every `push` or `pull request` to the `main` branch <br>
ðŸ”¹ - Python environment setup with `Poetry` <br>
ðŸ”¹ - Automatic installation of development dependencies <br>
ðŸ”¹ - Execution of `make quality` rule to ensure code standardization <br>
